The Aquila admin theme.

== Description ==

A clean black and gold color scheme for WordPress Admin (v4.0 onwards). Used by [Design by Mito](https://designbymito.com/) for client websites, Aquila also cleans up the admin area from unnecessary or potentially confusing items.

Many updates have been made to the admin area, including:

*		Admin area re-design.
*		"Posts" renamed to "Blog".
*   Dashboard metaboxes removed and cleaned up.
*   User "Profile" area cleaned up and simplified.
*   Aquila logos and icons.
*   Current user role added as an admin body class.
*   Removed "How are you.." from the top-right corner.
*		Re-designed login screen.
*		Items removed from admin bar.
*		New dashboard widgets.
*		WordPress and plugins support links on dashboard.
*		"Update" notifications hidden from Editors.
*		"Post Format" removed from posts.
*		Multisite support

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to configure this plugin or change any settings? =

No. All settings are applied automatically once the plugin is activated, but there is now an "Aquila Settings" page to refine these options if you wish to do so.

= Does this plugin make any changes to the website's front-end? =

No. It only changes the admin area, the login page and the admin bar for logged-in users.

Material Design inspired admin theme with a black and gold colour scheme. Add your own custom logo to match your website.

== Description ==

A Material Design inspired black and gold colour scheme for WordPress Admin (v4.0 onwards). Used by [Design by Mito](https://designbymito.com/) for client websites, Aquila also cleans up the admin area from unnecessary or potentially confusing items.

Many updates have been made to the admin area, including:

*   Admin area complete re-design.
*   Use your own logo instead of the WordPress logo in the admin area and login screen.
*   Roboto typeface to match Material Design guidelines.
*   "Posts" renamed to "Blog" (can be changed back in Aquila Settings).
*   Dashboard metaboxes removed and cleaned up.
*   User "Profile" area cleaned up and simplified.
*   New custom icon pack.
*   Current user role added as an admin body class.
*   Removed "How are you.." from the top-right corner.
*   Re-designed login screen.
*   Admin bar de-cluttered.
*   New dashboard widgets.
*   WordPress and plugins support links on dashboard.
*   "Update" notifications hidden from Editors.
*   "Post Format" removed from posts.
*   Multisite support.
*   View server information directly on the dashboard.
*   Media Library support for clear PNG images.
*   Aquila Settings page to control most of these options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to configure this plugin or change any settings? =

No. All settings are applied automatically once the plugin is activated, but there is now an "Aquila Settings" page to refine these options if you wish to do so.

= Can I change the Aquila "eagle" logo to my own company's logo? =

Yes. Go to **Settings > Aquila Settings** to upload a new logo image. PNGs with a clear background and white foreground work best.

= Does this plugin make any changes to the website's front-end? =

No. It only changes the admin area, the login page and the admin bar for logged-in users.
